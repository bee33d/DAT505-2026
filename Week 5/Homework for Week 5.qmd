## Context

In 1971, Moore and Krupat were interested in the "social mechanics" of conformity. They wanted to know: Is conformity driven by **who you are** (your personality) or by **who you are talking to** (social status)?

They measured:

-   **Conformity**: The number of times a participant agreed with a partner's incorrect judgment.

-   **F-Score**: A personality scale measuring "Authoritarianism" (higher scores = more rigid/authoritarian).

-   **Partner Status**: An experimental manipulation where the partner was either "High" status (an expert) or "Low" status (a peer).

## Part 1: Conformism and authoritarianism

*You begin with a simple hypothesis: People with authoritarian personalities are naturally more likely to conform, regardless of the situation.*

### Question 1

Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between `fscore` (x-axis) and `conformity` (y-axis). Add a linear regression line.

### Question 2

Fit a linear model (m1) where fscore predicts conformity.

### Question 3

Mathematically, the intercept is the predicted value of Y when X=0. Look at your output. Does an fscore of 0 exist in your dataset? If not, does the intercept have a meaningful "real-world" interpretation here?

### Question 4

For every 1-point increase on the F-scale, exactly how many more (or fewer) times is a person expected to conform?

### Question 5

Look at the p-value. How do you interpret this number? Conclude on what you can infer or not from this sample.

## Part 2: Experiment

*Your colleague disagrees with you. They argue that personality is irrelevant; what matters is the social pressure. If your partner is an "Expert" (High Status), you conform. If they are a "Peer" (Low Status), you don't.*

### Question 6

Fit a model (m2) where partner.status predicts conformity.

### Question 7

R uses automatic "Dummy Coding" when dealing with categorical predictors. In your output, which group is being treated as the "Baseline" (the Intercept)? How can you tell?

### Question 8

Based *only* on the "Estimate" column in your summary, what is the exact average conformity score for the low-status group?

### Question 9

A student claims you should have used an *Independent Samples t-test* here instead of a Linear Model. Explain why the p-value of the partner.statuslow coefficient in your lm output is identical to the p-value you would get from a t-test.

### Question 10

Run the code below. What does it do? What do you conclude?

### Question 11

Generate a plot to illustrate the effect of the experiment (including a representation of the linear model). Conclude on the results of this experiment.
